'''
Write a program that implements multiplication using while loop.

Hint:
    1. Multiplication is just repeated addition.
        -> 2 * 3 = 2 + 2 + 2
        -> 4 * 2 = 4 + 4
        -> 3 * 5 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3

Note:
    1. Take input parameters from the user at runtime.
    2. Ignore negative integers for now.
